## Overview

A lightweight, pip-installable Python library that aims to provide fuzzy string matching and ranking capabilities. With support for various custom scorers like Levenshtein, token sort, and Jaccard, FuzzyBunny will allow you to perform both partial and full matches with adjustable thresholds for flexible and speedy string comparisons.

## Current Status

The project is in the early stages of development. The setup is complete, and we are working on implementing the core features.
